## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict sales based on various input features. The notebook performs the following tasks:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and optimization
- Model evaluation and interpretation

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in a business context to support data-driven decision-making.

## Installation and Setup

To run this notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/sales-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sales-prediction
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate # For Linux/macOS
   env\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   ```

## Dataset Information

- **Source:** [Provide the dataset source if applicable, e.g., Kaggle, UCI, etc.]
- **Description:** The dataset includes features such as:
  - Product details
  - Store information
  - Sales figures over a specific time period
  - Additional contextual factors (e.g., holidays, promotions)
- **Size:** [Provide dataset size if known]
- **Format:** CSV or any other format used
